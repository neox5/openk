## System Design and Architecture

### 1. Design the System Architecture

To build a modular and extensible password/secret management platform, we'll adopt a layered architecture with well-defined interfaces. This approach allows components to be developed, tested, and replaced independently without affecting the overall system.

#### Core Components

#### Component Interactions

1. **M4** (API Layer) receives requests and authenticates them via **M5** (Authentication and Authorization Module).
2. Upon successful authentication, requests are forwarded to **M3** (Secret Management Module).
3. **M3** interacts with **M2** (Encryption Module) to encrypt/decrypt secrets.
4. Encrypted secrets are stored or retrieved through **M1** (Storage Backend Interface Module).
