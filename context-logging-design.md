# Context and Logging Design Document

## Overview
This document captures the design decisions for context and logging management in OpenK. It serves as a foundation for implementation and future discussions.

## Topics Discussion Status

### 1. Context Lifetime & Management âœ“
- Completed initial discussion
- Core patterns established
- Ready for implementation

### 2. Correlation ID Management
- Not started
- Next topic for discussion

### 3. Error Context
- Not started

### 4. Component Integration
- Not started

### 5. Logging Hierarchy
- Not started

### 6. Security Considerations
- Not started

### 7. Observability Boundaries
- Not started

## Established Patterns

### Context Enrichment Order & Responsibility

1. **Service Information (Startup)**
   - Added via WithService
   - Foundation for all logging
   - First context enrichment

2. **Trace ID (Request Level)**
   - First middleware in chain
   - Use existing from headers if present
   - Generate new if not present
   - No separate request ID needed

3. **Authentication Information**
   - Separate middleware
   - Added after trace handling
   - Only where needed

### Base Logging Configuration

#### Development Environment
- Include line info only
- Focus on debugging capability

#### Production Environment
- Include service attributes:
  - Service name
  - Service version
  - Instance identifier
- Focus on observability

### Trace ID Handling
- Configurable behavior:
  - Accept/reject invalid formats
  - Create new ID if invalid/missing (y/n)
  - Log trace ID issues (y/n)
- Follow industry standards where applicable
- Configurable defaults

### Goroutine Context Management
- Use full context propagation
- Maintain all trace IDs and logging context
- Keep complete observability within server system

### Error Handling in Context
- Use existing context/span
- Log errors within current context
- No new spans/contexts for errors

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Planning**
   - Review interfaces needed
   - Define configuration structures
   - Plan middleware implementation

2. **Continue Discussions**
   - Move to Correlation ID Management
   - Define specific patterns
   - Consider security implications

3. **Documentation**
   - Update ADRs as needed
   - Create implementation guides
   - Document configuration options

## Future Considerations
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Distributed tracing patterns
- Metrics collection
- Performance impact analysis
